This C# console application is designed to:
- Use the Random class to generate an integer between 1 and 5.
- Use a nullable string? to collect input as a string from users and store it in another string.
- Use the TryParse method to convert the string to a number.
- Use a bool type to return true or not if it is a number.
- Use a nested 'if-elseif-else' construct to ensure the input is a number.
- Use an outer do-while loop to ensure the condition is met.

- Output looks like this:

Guess a number between 1 and 4
z
